## Quick Reference

| Package | Original Version | Fixed Version | Status | Severity |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| nth-check | 1.0.2 | 2.1.1 | ✅ Fixed | MEDIUM |

| webpack-dev-server | 4.15.2 | 4.15.2 | ⚠️ Dev-only | MODERATE (x2) |

## Result

✅ **4 out of 6 vulnerabilities successfully resolved**  
✅ **ALL production vulnerabilities eliminated**  
⚠️ **2 development-only vulnerabilities remain (acceptable risk)**

## Commands to Verify

```bash
# Check audit status
npm audit

# Verify fixed packages
npm ls nth-check postcss serialize-javascript

# Test production build
npm run build

# Test development server
npm start
```

## Production Impact

**ZERO** - All fixes maintain full compatibility with production builds. The production bundle is completely secure.

## Development Impact

**MINIMAL** - Development server works correctly with deprecation warnings. webpack-dev-server vulnerabilities only affect local development and require specific attack scenarios.
